# VARS – Vehicle Attitude Reference System

VARS is an ESP32-based colour cockpit display for visualising vehicle attitude (roll and pitch).

It is designed for camper vans and similar DIY vehicle projects and focuses on calm, stable visualisation for vehicle levelling while parked. VARS prioritises clear geometry, predictable behaviour and a defensive, neighbour-friendly warning philosophy.

-VARS is an open-source DIY project. It is not intended for safety-critical, certified or regulatory-relevant applications.
